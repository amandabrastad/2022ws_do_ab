### THE APPLE EXAMPLE
- Look at Apple, and the book of Steve Jobs
    - At the time is was the apple 2e which Apple made a lot of money on, then Steve Jobs came back and built the Macintosh
    - So at the same time you had the old apple 2e and the more modern
    macintosh 
    - Wich means Apple was ambidextours, milikng the market with apple 2e
    and innovating with the macintosh 
    - Apple needed the apple 2e for income and keeping the     company alive, but they also needed to develop the macintosh, otherwise they probably would not have been alive today 

How does an organization both do what is keeping them alive and innovate at the same time?

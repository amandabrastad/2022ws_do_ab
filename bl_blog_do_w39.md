## What do we want to know about ambidexterous organizations? 

### THE APPLE EXAMPLE
- Look at Apple, and the book of Steve Jobs
    - At the time it was the apple 2e which Apple made a lot of money on, then Steve Jobs came back and built the Macintosh
    - So at the same time you had the old apple 2e and the more modern
    macintosh 
    - Wich means Apple was ambidextours, milikng the market with apple 2e
    and innovating with the macintosh 
    - Apple needed the apple 2e for income and keeping the     company alive, but they also needed to develop the macintosh, otherwise they probably would not have been alive today 

How does an organization both do what is keeping them alive and innovate at the same time?

## A Harvars busniess Review article on Ambidextours Organisations 

Source: O'Reily, C.A. & Tushman, M.L. (2014). The Ambidextrous Organization. Harward Business Review. [Link](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization) 

The article states that:
- Managers need to be able to attend to their products at the same time as they are innovating for the future
- Or in other words explore the new at the same time as exploting the old
- A famous example of how not to do it is Kodak whom made the digital camera, but desided to stick with wath they knew, and not to use more time on the digital camera, as we all know that did not go werry well. 

- A lot of companies fail to be ambidextours, but what is the sucsess formula? 
- Some say it is cross-functional teams, other say you alternate between focusing on old and new
- O'Reily and Tusman (2014) tests the theories!

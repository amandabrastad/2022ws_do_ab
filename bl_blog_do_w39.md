## What do we want to know about ambidexterous organizations? 

### THE APPLE EXAMPLE
- Look at Apple, and the book of Steve Jobs
    - At the time it was the apple 2e which Apple made a lot of money on, then Steve Jobs came back and built the Macintosh
    - So at the same time you had the old apple 2e and the more modern
    macintosh 
    - Wich means Apple was ambidextours, milikng the market with apple 2e
    and innovating with the macintosh 
    - Apple needed the apple 2e for income and keeping the     company alive, but they also needed to develop the macintosh, otherwise they probably would not have been alive today 

How does an organization both do what is keeping them alive and innovate at the same time?

## A Harvars busniess Review article on Ambidextours Organisations 

Source: O'Reily, C.A. & Tushman, M.L. (2014). The Ambidextrous Organization. Harward Business Review. [Link](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization) 

The article states that:
- Managers need to be able to attend to their products at the same time as they are innovating for the future
- Or in other words explore the new at the same time as exploting the old
- A famous example of how not to do it is Kodak whom made the digital camera, but desided to stick with wath they knew, and not to use more time on the digital camera, as we all know that did not go werry well. 

- A lot of companies fail to be ambidextours, but what is the sucsess formula? 
- Some say it is cross-functional teams, other say you alternate between focusing on old and new
- O'Reily and Tusman (2014) tests the theories!

## Beeing explorative and exploitative at the same time [O'Reily and Tushman, 2014](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization)

- To be explorative and exploirative at the same time, a company needs to do incremetnal and discontinous inovations at the same time.
- Where breaktroughs from Ambidezxtrous organixations came from structurally independent units in the organization.
    - Where strucurally independents means that they have their own processes and their own culture. Almost like a new organization within the organization. 
- They also found that breaktroughs comming from ambidextrous organizations where way more ofthen sucsessful than with the other structues.

> " At a theoretical level, it’s easy to explain why ambidextrous organizations would outperform other organizational types. The structure of ambidextrous organizations allows cross-fertilization among units while preventing cross-contamination. The tight coordination at the managerial level enables the fledgling units to share important resources from the traditional units—cash, talent, expertise, customers, and so on—but the organizational separation ensures that the new units’ distinctive processes, structures, and cultures are not overwhelmed by the forces of “business as usual.” At the same time, the established units are shielded from the distractions of launching new businesses; they can continue to focus all their attention and energy on refining their operations, improving their products, and serving their customers" -  [O'Reily and Tushman, 2014](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization) 

That's in theory, how does it work in practise?

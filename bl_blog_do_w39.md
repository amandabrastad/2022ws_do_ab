# Ambidextrous organizations 

We have many examples of organizations that were once large and powerful, who have failed to succeed in the modern world. Maybe the most famous one is Kodak who actually was the one to develop the digital camera, but decided to stick with what they know thinking the digital camera was not worth investing in. Or the one time home movie industry leader Blockbuster offering people to rent DVDs. Blockbuster was offered to buy Netflix which at the time was a new concept, but they declined.

What was the biggest mistake of these and many other companies, or what could they have done to succeed? One road to success is managing to be an Ambidextrous organization. 

## What is an Ambidextrous organizations? 

The word ambidextrous itself means being able to use both hands equally well(1). For an organization to be an ambidextrous organization it means being able to attend to their current products at the same time as they are innovating for the future(2). No company succeeds forever, if you are not the one to make the product that kills your company, somebody else will!   

One company that has succeeded being ambidextrous is Apple. Early on Apple had the Apple 2e which made a lot of money, then Steve Jobs came back and built the Macintosh. Therefore at the same time you had the old Apple 2e and the modern Macintosh. Where Apple 2e was milking the current market and the Macintosh was an invention. Making 2e responsible for Apple's income at the time, keeping the company alive, and creating money used on developing the macintosh. Apple managed to be an ambidextrous organization, if they had decided to “stick with what works” and only focused on the 2e we can assume they would not exist today.

## How does it work?

According to [O’Reilly and Tushman (2004)](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization) managers need to be able to attend to their products at the same time as they are innovating for the future(3),  just like Apple did with the Apple 2e and the Macintosh. In other words they need to be able to explore at the same time as they exploit. Which may sound like an easy thing to do, but a lot of companies fail to be ambidextrous even if they are aware they should be.  O’Reily and Tushman (2004) takes a look at the theories, some say that you need cross-functional teams, others say you have to alternate between focusing on old products and new products. 

O’Reily and Tushman (2004) found that companies who have indeed succeeded at being ambidextrous share some characteristics. The main one being: They separate their explorative and exploitative units. 

![Image of separate explorative and exploitative units](separate_explorative_and_exploitative_units.jpg)

_Even if the examples or explanations mentions are regarding products, being ambidextrous also applies to companies selling services._

This means doing incremental and discontinuous innovation at the same time. An incremental innovations is a stepwise or a small improvements to your product(4), while a discontinuous innovation is about introducing an entirely new product to the market(5). Where the breakthroughs or the discontinuous innovations come from a structurally independent unit in the organization. In general O’Reily and Tushman (2004) found that breakthroughs coming from ambidextrous organizations were way more often successful than breakthroughs coming from organizations with other structures. 

## Why does it work? 

From a theoretical perspective ambidextrous organizations work better because their structure allows the organization to “cross-fertilization among units while preventing cross-contamination” O’Reily and Tushman (2004). Which means they can share what benefits them both like knowledge, customers or income. At the same time the new and explorative unit is not contaminated by the old way of thinking for the company. In addition the old unit is not affected by distractions coming from the explorative unit trying to launch a new business(6).

If you like to watch videos instead of reading please take a look at the videos mentioned above. 

As we now already know, ambidextrous organizations take care of today's business with one hand and innovation with the other, and benefit from this separation of culture, processes and people. The problem being that innovation in one unit is disruptive to the business in the other unit. The separation of the units in the business is the tool to make this easier, but a lot of businesses still fail to be ambidextrous. This is also known as “Innovator’s Dilemma”, which is a book or theory by Clayton Christensen explaining how businesses' success and capabilities are also the thing that make them fail when it comes to new markets or technologies(7). Where being your own disruptive technology, by managing to be ambidextrous, is the solution. 

Why do businesses fail to be ambidextrous? First of all it is challenging for the core management, who are supposed to lead both units at the same time as they are being kept completely separate. The innovative side needs leaders, teams and resources appropriate for an innovative unit. Further not enough training and development for the team who has to learn how to do new things, for instance through [design thinking](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-design-thinking-and-why-is-it-so-popular) or [lean startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup). Or when there is a new idea there is no agreement within management on whether to go with the innovation or not, which is believed to be what happened with Kodak and the digital camera. 

What is then needed to succeed in being ambidextrous? 
* The right setup trough separate units in the organization 
* The right leaders with mindset and skills to lead both teams 
* A team with the right training and motivation to invent
* Balancing the exploration and exploitation

How does a business balance exploration and exploitation? To give room for innovation you could make use of a well communicated strategy that guides the business in the right direction through encouraging innovation. Then there are the right people in the right place, a person who is doing really well in your exploitation unit might not be the right person to send to the exploration unit. You need people and teams who understand the markets and understand what it is that consumers want in the future. Further the business needs to allocate the right resources to the right team. On one hand you want the old business to milk the market and keep the customers for as long as possible, while at the same time the innovative team needs the customers, information and understanding to develop the right products. Therefore this is a tough balancing act. 

Communication is also a tough balancing act, because you want the teams to be independent and not negatively affect each other, but they also benefit from communication and thorough understanding. It can also lead to conflicts between the units, because the resources of the company will be important for both units of the company. If you do not run your exploitative unit well you can go bankrupt today, and if you do not run your explorative unit well you will go bankrupt in the future. Conflicts between units add to the negative aspects of trying to be an ambidextrous organization. Another negative aspect of ambidexterity is that it is expensive to do. It is maybe easy to imagine that Google can afford to have a unit of exploitation, but imagine a small company that maybe barely can afford to have their own core unit, or just barely have enough people for the core business. Then it will be expensive to start up an entirely new unit just to explore and innovate. 

In general we also know from leadership theory that most people are opposed to change, and scared to fail. Putting together an innovative team, that team needs to be allowed to fail. Allowed to explore options that do not work, and room to be creative. Using people from the course business adds the benefits of thorough understanding and knowledge, but also adds the risk of contamination of old culture or thinking that limits innovation. 

![Image of balancing the ambidextrous units](balance_units.jpg)

There is no simple solution or recipe to balance in the right way. If it was simple everyone would do it, and every company could be a successful company. 

As we now understand there are many pitfalls of not managing to be an ambidextrous organization. But if one manages to avoid the pitfalls, the added benefits from ambidexterity are great:
* Adaptability: The world is changing fast, and especially the new and digital world. The capability to adapt is strongly needed in today's business world. 
* Avoid stagnation: Like mentioned several times, sticking with what we know because it has worked so well in the past will lead to eventually losing our customers to disruptive technology. 
* Profit: As we see with successful ambidextrous organizations today like Google or Apple. Given that you succeed in milking the market and innovating the next thing to take over at the same time. Where the exploitative unit is responsible for short-term profit and the explorative for the long-term profit. 

### A different perspective on ambidexterity 
Organizational ambidexterity can be seen from more perspectives than the one described above. While the one described is referred to as contextual ambidexterity, which states organizations need to address exploration and exploitation simultaneously (8).  The other perspective is structural ambidexterity where the organization cycles through periods of exploitation and periods of exploration (8). Where managing both at once can be seen as more complicated than managing one at the time. 

According to [Budoian (2021)](https://digitalleadership.com/blog/ambidextrous-organization/). The outcomes are the same, first of all innovation but also that having explorative and exploitative units positively relates to growth rate. Further successful ambidextrous companies, the capability to be ambidextrous is their foundation for continued success. Like British Airways with increased customer satisfaction, or Apple still being successful (8) from starting their ambidextrous journey with the Macintosh in 1985. 

There seems to be little difference between contextual and structural ambidexterity, because the main goal of ambidexterity is managing to explore and exploit. [Lerner & Zieris (2019)](https://www.cutter.com/article/ambidextrous-organizations-how-embrace-disruption-and-create-organizational-advantage-502561) created a canvas to help oranizational managers to excel in both dimensions. Where they show how businesses that are good at exploitation or productivity have capabilities like controlling, monitoring, history and experience, and businesses that are good at exploration or creativity have good insight, foresight, inspiration and trial & error procedures (9).  Lerner & Zieris (2019) explain how managers can go through the six dimensions of steering, transformation, people, culture, structure and process to make sure they are ready to be an ambidextrous organization. 

Whether it is following a framework or having a different perspective on ambidexterity does not really matter, as we have seen there are many benefits from managing to be an ambidextrous organization and it is hard to become one.

## What does Ambidextrous mean?

Ambidextrous is defined by [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ambidextrous) as being able to use both hands equally well.

## So what does it mean when an organization is Ambidextrous? 

For an organization to be ambidextrous it needs to be able to both be efficient doing what it does to day,
at the same time as it is innovating for the future. 

---

## What do we want to know about ambidextrous organizations? 

### THE APPLE EXAMPLE
- Look at Apple, and the book of Steve Jobs
    - At the time it was the apple 2e which Apple made a lot of money on, then Steve Jobs came back and built the Macintosh
    - So at the same time you had the old apple 2e and the more modern
    macintosh 
    - Which means Apple was ambidextrous, milking the market with apple 2e
    and innovating with the macintosh 
    - Apple needed the apple 2e for income and keeping the     company alive, but they also needed to develop the macintosh, otherwise they probably would not have been alive today 

How does an organization both do what is keeping them alive and innovate at the same time?

## A Harvard Business Review  article on Ambidextrous Organizations 

Source: O’Reilly, C.A. & Tushman, M.L. (2014). The Ambidextrous Organization. Harvard Business Review. [Link](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization) 

The article states that:
- Managers need to be able to attend to their products at the same time as they are innovating for the future
- Or in other words explore the new at the same time as exploiting the old
- A famous example of how not to do it is Kodak whom made the digital camera, but decided to stick with what they knew, and not to use more time on the digital camera, as we all know that did not go very well. 

- A lot of companies fail to be ambidextrous, but what is the success formula? 
- Some say it is cross-functional teams, other say you alternate between focusing on old and new
- O’Reilly and Tushman (2014) tests the theories!

## Sucsessfull Ambidextrous Organisations according to [O’Reilly and Tushman, 2014](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization)

- They found that companies being successful, at being ambidextrous, share some characteristics, the main one being: 

> They separate their explorative and their exploitative units.

## Beeing explorative and exploitative at the same time [O’Reilly and Tushman, 2014](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization)

- To be explorative and explorative at the same time, a company needs to do incremental and discontinuous innovations at the same time.
- Where breakthroughs from Ambidextrous organizations came from structurally independent units in the organization.
    - Where structurally independents means that they have their own processes and their own culture. Almost like a new organization within the organization. 
- They also found that breakthroughs coming from ambidextrous organizations where way more often successful than with the other structures.

> " At a theoretical level, it’s easy to explain why ambidextrous organizations would outperform other organizational types. The structure of ambidextrous organizations allows cross-fertilization among units while preventing cross-contamination. The tight coordination at the managerial level enables the fledgling units to share important resources from the traditional units—cash, talent, expertise, customers, and so on—but the organizational separation ensures that the new units’ distinctive processes, structures, and cultures are not overwhelmed by the forces of “business as usual.” At the same time, the established units are shielded from the distractions of launching new businesses; they can continue to focus all their attention and energy on refining their operations, improving their products, and serving their customers" -  [O’Reilly and Tushman, 2014](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization) 

That's in theory, how does it work in practice?

## Disruptive innovations

Why is there a need to be Ambidextrous? The need to be ambidextrous may come from what we define as Disruptive innovations.

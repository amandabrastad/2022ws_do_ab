## So what does it mean when an organization is Ambidextrous? 

For an organization to be ambidextrous it needs to be able to both be efficient doing what it does to day,
at the same time as it is innovating for the future.

## What do we want to know about ambidextrous organizations? 

### THE APPLE EXAMPLE
- Look at Apple, and the book of Steve Jobs
    - At the time it was the apple 2e which Apple made a lot of money on, then Steve Jobs came back and built the Macintosh
    - So at the same time you had the old apple 2e and the more modern
    macintosh 
    - Which means Apple was ambidextrous, milking the market with apple 2e
    and innovating with the macintosh 
    - Apple needed the apple 2e for income and keeping the     company alive, but they also needed to develop the macintosh, otherwise they probably would not have been alive today 

How does an organization both do what is keeping them alive and innovate at the same time?

## A Harvard Business Review  article on Ambidextrous Organizations 

Source: O’Reilly, C.A. & Tushman, M.L. (2014). The Ambidextrous Organization. Harvard Business Review. [Link](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization) 

The article states that:
- Managers need to be able to attend to their products at the same time as they are innovating for the future
- Or in other words explore the new at the same time as exploiting the old
- A famous example of how not to do it is Kodak whom made the digital camera, but decided to stick with what they knew, and not to use more time on the digital camera, as we all know that did not go very well. 

- A lot of companies fail to be ambidextrous, but what is the success formula? 
- Some say it is cross-functional teams, other say you alternate between focusing on old and new
- O’Reilly and Tushman (2014) tests the theories!

## Sucsessfull Ambidextrous Organisations according to [O’Reilly and Tushman, 2014](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization)

- They found that companies being successful, at being ambidextrous, share some characteristics, the main one being: 

> They separate their explorative and their exploitative units.

## Beeing explorative and exploitative at the same time [O’Reilly and Tushman, 2014](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization)

- To be explorative and explorative at the same time, a company needs to do incremental and discontinuous innovations at the same time.
- Where breakthroughs from Ambidextrous organizations came from structurally independent units in the organization.
    - Where structurally independents means that they have their own processes and their own culture. Almost like a new organization within the organization. 
- They also found that breakthroughs coming from ambidextrous organizations where way more often successful than with the other structures.

> " At a theoretical level, it’s easy to explain why ambidextrous organizations would outperform other organizational types. The structure of ambidextrous organizations allows cross-fertilization among units while preventing cross-contamination. The tight coordination at the managerial level enables the fledgling units to share important resources from the traditional units—cash, talent, expertise, customers, and so on—but the organizational separation ensures that the new units’ distinctive processes, structures, and cultures are not overwhelmed by the forces of “business as usual.” At the same time, the established units are shielded from the distractions of launching new businesses; they can continue to focus all their attention and energy on refining their operations, improving their products, and serving their customers" -  [O’Reilly and Tushman, 2014](https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization) 

That's in theory, how does it work in practice?
